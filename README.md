Project Overview
This project aims to help farmers detect plant diseases by leveraging deep learning techniques. The website utilizes a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) model trained on the Tomato dataset from the New Plant Diseases Dataset. The model is built using TensorFlow and Keras to classify different tomato plant diseases effectively.
